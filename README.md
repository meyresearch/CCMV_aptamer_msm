# CCMV_aptamer_msm

This repository contains the CCMV aptamer simulation data and its analysis using Markov State Model (MSM) in [https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202301.0553/v1]. The Markov state modelling was done using package [pyemma](http://www.emma-project.org/latest/) v.2.5.7. 

MD simulation input files can be found in the [md](./md) folder

Trajectory and topology fils can be found in the [data](./data) folder

MSM construction, validation, and analysis are done in jupyter notebooks: [msm_estimation](./msm_estimation.ipynb) and [msm_analysis](./msm_analysis.ipynb).
